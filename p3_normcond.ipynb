    "### 1. **p3_normcond** exploring norms and condition numbers.\n",
    "#### The purpose of this code is to explore different vector and matrix norms and compute condition numbers to assess numerical stability. It calculates norms like the 1-norm, 2-norm, infinity norm, and Frobenius norm for vectors and matrices. The code also examines how condition numbers indicate the sensitivity of a matrix to input changes, which can affect the accuracy of numerical solutions. This analysis is essential for understanding the stability and performance of algorithms in linear algebra.\n",

    "#### A **norm** is a mathematical function that measures the size, length, or magnitude of a vector or matrix. It provides a way to quantify how large an object is in a given space, and different types of norms (such as 1-norm, 2-norm, and infinity-norm) measure this size in different ways. Norms are widely used in linear algebra, optimization, and numerical analysis to understand the behavior of vectors and matrices.

    "The **condition number** of a matrix quantifies how sensitive the solution of a system of linear equations is to small changes or errors in the matrix or the right-hand side vector. It is typically calculated as the ratio of the largest singular value to the smallest singular value of the matrix. A matrix with a small condition number (close to 1) is considered well-conditioned, meaning small changes in input result in small changes in the output. A matrix with a large condition number is ill-conditioned, indicating that small errors in the input can cause large deviations in the solution, potentially leading to numerical instability.\n",
